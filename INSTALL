Pre-Installation
----------------

First install these perl modules:

 $ cpan

And from the span prompt:

 install Config::Simple
 install WebService::TicketAuth::DBI
 
 # You might have to do: force install RDF::Simple to skip tests on mysql db
 install RDF::Simple



Installation
------------

To install the script and man pages in the standard areas,
give the sequence of commands


 $ perl Makefile.PL
 $ make
 $ make test         # this is not currently configured (failure will happen)
 $ make install      # you probably need to do this step as superuser

If you want to install the script in your own private space, use

 $ perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/home/joeuser DESTDIR=/home/joeuser \
        INSTALLMAN1DIR=/home/joeuser/man/man1 \
        INSTALLMAN3DIR=/home/joeuser/man/man3      
 $ make
 $ make test
 $ make install      # can do this step as joeuser

Note that `make test` does nothing interesting.



Running with DMS
----------------

To test the system with the dms daemon. Do the following as super-user:

    cp etc/dms.conf /etc/dms.conf
    mkdir /var/dms
   
    use SOAP::Transport::HTTP;
    use SVG::Metadata;
    use Document::Manager;
    use Getopt::Long;
   
Now run scripts/dmsd

To check output, then run scripts/dmsd, but to run in the background:

    scripts/dmsd &


Uninstallation
--------------

Under a user with sufficient permissions and from the program
distribution directory, execute

  perl Makefile.PL

if there isn't a file called Makefile.  Then execute

  make uninstall

This sometimes works, and sometimes it does not.  If it refuses to work,
you can simply remove all files by hand.  Look for the .packlist file
which perl created when installing the software and remove all files you
find in there.
