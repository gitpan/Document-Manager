This is the README file for dms, a Document Management System.

This package implements a backend document system, implemented in
layers.  

Document::Repository is the foundation of the application.  It provides
low level access to the document repository itself, performing the file
operations to add, get, and update entries in the repository's file
system.  It is not intended to be used directly, however administration
scripts are provided for operating directly on the files.  These scripts
are repo_*.

Document::Manager is a mid-level interface, that wrappers
Document::Repository.  It provides an API that can be used by clients
for interacting with the system.

dmsd is a SOAP-based daemon that provides access to Document::Manager as
a service on port 8012.  It provides access for clients to any routine
in Document::Manager via the SOAP protocol.

submit_clipart is a client tool for scanning a directory structure and
submitting any *.svg files it finds there to the central repository.

ls_docs is another client tool for listing the document id's in the
repository. 

For instructions on how to install this application, see the
file INSTALL.
